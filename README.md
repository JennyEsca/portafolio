This project is about creating my portfolio, in this project I use bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/  to code the navigation bar, buttons, cards, grid, footer and contact form. Also I used some CSS for style some parts which were limited in Bootstrap. 



Resources List:
- Fonts from Google fonts:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Dosis:wght@200&display=swap

- The images were from photo banks due to the services that I offered are not easy to show by photografy 
https://www.pexels.com/ and https://www.freepik.es/ 

- The logo was created by myself using Ai 

- For support some proccess that I did not understand I went to the program page 
https://imdac.github.io/mtm6130/ 

- For CSS Animations 
https://animate.style/


The most challenging part for me was, trying to resize the photos, I was confused because Bootstrap provided me a responsive site, however, I tried to use picture this for my header image and I could not get it. As well as align the navigation bar to the rigth.
